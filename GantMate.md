# GantMate

## GantMate

GantMate allows you to run Gant tasks for your project from within TextMate.  It is currently available from
here for testing purposes but will be integrated into the Groovy bundle eventually.

### Installation

Grap the two zips from above. Unzip GantMate.zip and place in `~/Library/Application
Support/TextMate/Bundles/Groovy.tmbundle/Support/`.  Unzip Run Gant Task.tmCommand.zip and double click to
install. It should install itself in the Groovy bundle.

### Usage

The default key mapping is control+shift+g and is scoped to Groovy source files.
