# Developer Access

The Gant mainline repository is the Git repository held at GitHub, see
<https://github.com/Gant/Gant> . People should fork this on GitHub, clone to
their local machine, create a feature branch so that master remains a mirror,
create changes (with tests, of course) and then create a pull request.
