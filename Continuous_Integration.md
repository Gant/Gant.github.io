# Continuous Integration

Having automated continuous integration builds is definitely a good thing. So,
quite naturally, Gant has some.

Here is a Bamboo build at Codehaus:

---|---
Build server | Atlassian Bamboo
Operating system | Unknown (JDK1.6)
Repository modification check | After each commit, but waiting about 10 minutes to capture all of a rapid sequence.

Here is the TravisCI build   ![](https://travis-ci.org/Gant/Gant.svg)
